this is a really simple project that I made for learning more about nextjs

## how to run it
first of all you need to have node.js.
Then you need to run the next command
```
npm install
```
After the dependencies are installed you can run the next command
```
npm run dev
```
and then go to `localhost:3000`
Also, you have to set up the env variables. and for that you only need to check the file `.env.local`
and put a key.
Im using the api of [fireworks](https://www.fireworks.ai/), is free and useful, you can use it if you want to.
